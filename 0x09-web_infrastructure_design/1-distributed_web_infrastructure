For every additional element, why you are adding it

Load balancer is used to distribute the request between the two servers
Additional server: which can be used to less the load on the individual server to improve efficience

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
The Round robin scheduling algorithm

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
